Aimed at enhancing video watching experience. Using ai to recognise objects in the video and allow the user to access the information of the objects. The camera will capture where userâ€™s finger is pointing. By doing a simple open palm gesture, the tab of the information will pop out and can be closed with a close palm gesture.
